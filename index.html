      <h2><i>Why I Like Baseball</i></h2>
      <p>
       Baseball is my favorite sport because it is competitive and difficult.<br>
       I have to challenge myself and my teammates to get better. I have played<br>
       since I was just four years old and my father has taught me nearly everything<br>
       I know. Now I play for the team at Licking Heights along with the NC Bruins<br>
       travel team.

      <h2><i>Cincinnati Reds</i></h2>
      <p>
      Aside from playing baseball, I aslo enjoy watching it. My favorite team is<br>
      the Cincinnati Reds because my entire family is from Cincinnati and support<br>
      the team. I have been to many Reds games in the past and my favorite player,<br>
      a newer addition to the team is second baseman Scooter Gennett. He is an<br>
      inspiring player and I love to watch him play.
